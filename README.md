## SOLID Practice

##### Overview: Explain your reasoning for reorganizing the code. How were you using the three principles? If a principle did not apply, then just say so. Please build your final solution using ANT and submit the repo via your Slack channel.

1. Open Close - The main class is open for extension, by creating new objects of relevant classes, or whatever the engineer specifies to be done. 
2. Single Responsibility - The main class is only utilizing objects made from other classes.
3. Interface Segregartion - Interfaces are segregrated from the main portion of the program.

### File: Manager.Java
#### Contributer: Bailey Cheung bcg73
1. Open Close - The manager is open to extension by adding features that are unique to the manager but unable to be modified by the main class of the program. 
2. Single Responsibility - The manager class is responsible for one item, ie managing the worker it is set to manage.
3. Interface Segregartion - Interface is not being used here.
