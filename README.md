### Contributer: Chance Martin c_m906
Robot class is open to extension but close to modification. It solely implements the work class from the Workable interface. Nothing is dependent to it. 
If something was dependent to it, then it would have to extend the robot class, not change it.
The interface is not a part of the class, but implements it, keeping with interface segregation.
The robot class only focuses on the Robot's job, keeping with single responsibility, not a job from another class.
